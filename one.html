        <p class="b">It has been reported by several students that after the winter break,
            many students and teachers have caught Covid-19. An increase in Covid outbreaks is always
            expected after a holiday season, but this year's outbreaks are
            occuring at higher rates than predicted. To prevent getting sick,
            practice good sanitation by washing or sanitizing your hands frequently,
            and try not to touch your face at school. Additonally, if you feel sick,
            please be considerate and wear a mask, or stay home until you feel better to
            avoid making those around you sick. Midterms and the Iready assesment
            is coming up, and attending school during these next few weeks is crucial for
            students. Let's stay safe and sanitized for the rest of the semester!
